# nextjs-mongodb-stack-deployer
Deployer made in Go for my [nextjs-mongodb-stack](/mikkelrask/nextjs-mongodb-stack) thing, that, as the name implies, builds docker image for a nextjs website with a mongodb database and spins up the stack purely from environment variables.

## Download
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/mikkelrask/nextjs-mongodb-stack-deployer/releases) and download the latest version for your OS/Arch.

Can be placed in your `$PATH` for system wide callability.
